- - 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda
    and salt; set aside.
  - 2.  In a medium bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, butter, eggs and vanilla
    extract. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and gently whisk to combine.
    Do not overmix!
  - 3.  Spray a waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray, then preheat. Once the waffle
    maker is ready, add the batter according to the manufacturer's instructions and
    cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the waffle maker indicates they are ready. Serve
    immediately, or place in a 300-degree oven to keep warm. Leftover waffles can
    be wrapped in plastic wrap, placed in a ziploc bag and stored in the refrigerator
    for 2 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.
